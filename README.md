# shai-hulud-2-scanner
To help you scan your laptops/PCs/Servers for the malicious NPM packages associated with the "Shai-Hulud" cyberattack (referenced in the Gist you shared), I have created a Python script for you

# How to use
1. Download the project `git clone https://github.com/cccaaasser/shai-hulud-2-scanner`
2. Run the script `python shai-hulud-2-scanner/scan_shai_hulud_v2.py <project path>` to scan your project
3. Or you can also copy the `scan_shai_hulud_v2.py` to `/Users/<username>/` for scan every path under `<username>`
